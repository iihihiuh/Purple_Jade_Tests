# spoke / test suite
## General
##### This project contains an ARMv6-M Thumb Instruction Simulator `Spoke` and corresponding tests.
#### 1. Spoke
##### Spoke is an ARMv6-M Thumb Instruction Simulator, which reads in instruction streams and outputs expected outputs for every instruction. Every hardware implementation of ARMv6-M Thumb ISA should be able to produce the exact same output of this simulator to be deemed as correct.
#### 2. Test Suite
##### This project also contains assembly tests to verify correctness of hardware implementations of ARMv6-M Thumb ISA. Moreover, it also provides many untility functions in C++, which make contributing to this test suite eaiser.
##### It is highly encouraged to contribute to this test suite. As more tests are added, hardware tested by this test suite will become more robust.
#### 3. Additonal Supported instructions
##### In addition to required instructions by class. This simulator extends support for unsigned multiplication and division.
Binary Encoding|Flag|ASM|Description
---|---|---|---
0100000101 rm(3 bits) rd (3 bits)| Not Set | MULU Rd, Rd, Rn | Rd = $unsigned(Rd) * $unsigned(Rn)
0100000110 rm(3 bits) rd (3 bits)| Not Set | DIVU Rd, Rd, Rn | Rd = $unsigned(Rd) / $unsigned(Rn)
##### Note : Exceptions are not raised during division if divided by zero. Division by zero is essentially treated as noop by this simulator.
## Folder directory
Folder Name |Description
---|---
spoke|contains source files for simulator spoke
test/asm|contains some hand written asm tests
test/src|contains sources files to generate asm tests
test/bin|contains binary files generated by assmbler

## Build
##### To Compile `spoke` and generate tests run:
```
  $ make
```
##### Compiled simulator will be in `spoke/spoke`. 
##### Generated assembly tests will be in `test/asm`. Compiled machine code will be in `test/bin`.
## Usage
#### Export Path
```
  $ export PATH=/the/absolute/path/to/Purple_Jade_Tests/spoke:${PATH}
```
##### This command will put the path to spoke to environmental variable PATH. It is highly recommended to append this line to `.bashrc` in home directory. Thus, `spoke` can be invoked by typing spoke in command line terminals.
#### Run `spoke`
```
  $ spoke <test.bin> [options]
```
##### Options:
`-t` enable `spoke` to print traces to standard error

`-d` enable `spoke` execute only one instruction when user type return in terminal
##### example
```
  $ spoke test/bin/test_add.bin -t 2> replay_trace.tr > readable_trace.tr
```
##### The command above will print human readable instructin execution trace to readable_trace.tr and replay_trace.tr will contain traces you will use for trace replay during verification process.
##### Note: `2>` <file_name> means write the standard error output of a program to a file
#####       `>`  <file_name> means write the standard output of a program to a file

## Trace Decomposition
##### The default format of traces in trace_replay.tr is shown below.
PC|is_reg_write| rd address| rd value |is_mem_write | mem address| mem value|current flags
---|---| ---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
4 hex digits |1 hex digit|4 hex digits| 4 hex digits||1 hex digit|4 hex digits| 4 hex digits|1 hex digit
##### Flags are represented using a hex digit, its format is shown below
C|N|Z|V
---|---|---|--- 
4th bit|3rd bit|2nd bit|1st bit
##### example
##### This trace `00051000700f00000000000` means instruction at pc 0x0005 writes to register 7 a value of 0x00f0.
##### This trace `001c00000000010003fdf04` means instruction at pc 0x001c writes to memory 0x3 a value of 0xfdf0 and only N flag is set.
